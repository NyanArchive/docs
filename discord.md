# Discord rules


1 - Be kind!
Excessive swearing, rudeness and harassment as well as any type of discrimination will not be tolerated.

2 - Stay on topic!
Please keep your conversations relevant to the topic the channel is for. If you want to talk about something else, the #general channel is for you.
​
3 - No NSFW, seizure inducing, gore or any other type of disturbing material!
Swearing is fine, but otherwise keep it SFW!
​
4 - Do not spam!
Do not spam or flood the channel with repeated requests/questions, mentions, roleplay, images, bot commands, memes, or anything else. Have some chill.
​
5 - Do not get Political!
There are other servers you can share this type of content to.

6 - No advertising/self-promotion!
Do not advertise any unrelated services. Ask for permission from the staff first.
If you want live promotion, go to #live-promotion 

We also expect you to respect Discord's guidelines and Terms of Service. The TOS will always be enforced and the users breaking it reported!
