# Chat Rules

- **Be respectful and mindful of other users in the channel, and avoid flooding or spamming.** One person taking up half the screen at once is annoying, so avoid doing it wherever possible. Other people are trying to chat too!

- **Let the moderators handle issues in the chat.** You can point things out to them with the `!report` command and they'll handle the rest.

- **If someone gets timed out, silenced or restricted, leave them be and don't start talking about them.** If someone is restricted, their case involves only them and the game administration - absolutely nobody else!

- **Encourage fair play, and don't give attention to cheaters or other toxic users.** These people unfortunately do exist, and giving them attention can encourage them to continue, or provoke others to act as they do. Report them via the chat command `!report` or the buttons on their profile page and move on.

- **Keep the chat clean and appropriate for an all-ages community, avoiding NSFW topics where possible.** NSFW stuff really isn't appropriate for an all-ages community. Do what you like in private messages (within reason) but keep the public channels squeaky clean for everyone's sake.

- **Be mindful of what you share with others, especially if the content is potentially disturbing or very graphic in nature.** If you have to think twice about whether something is appropriate to link, it probably isn't okay. Avoid things with fast, strobing lights, gore, images of abuse or other graphic material.

- **Don't advertise third-party chat servers of any kind, including Discord, Teamspeak or Skype servers/groups.** The osu! chat is about osu! foremost and not about sharing links to your personal servers. Do it via PM if you absolutely have to.
