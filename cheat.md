# #No_Cheating

1. Cheating and multiaccount is strictly prohibited.
2. It doesn't matter if you cheated on any other osu! server - we only care about what you did on Ripple.
3. Multiaccounts are **NOT** allowed, with the **SOLE EXCEPTION OF CHAT BOTS**.  If you are developing one and need an account for it,  mail [support](mailto:osu@kakao.com) (or a [dev](mailto:ilsubyeega@naver.com))
4. We reserve the right to change these rules as we see fit.
